# FESTO Didactic Stations
## Description
In this project, three FESTO educational stations were used to create and implement a code for their automation using a Micrologix 1500 PLC. In the first station, the presence of a part is detected by inductive sensors, and pneumatic actuators are used to suction and transport it to the next station via a rotary arm. Subsequently, in the second station, the part is lifted by a pneumatic chain to an air chamber, which pushes the object to its deposit in the third station. Finally, in the third station, the part undergoes a labeling and drilling process performed by a rotary station.
